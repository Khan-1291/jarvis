2026-02-22 00:34:05,820 | INFO | LLM Response: Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself repeatedly until it reaches a base case that stops the recursion, sir. It's a method for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller instances of the same problem. Would you like me to provide an example, sir?, sir.

2026-02-22 23:57:17,534 | INFO | LLM Response: Recursion! It's like that one friend who keeps calling you and saying "hey, call me back" and then when you do, they say "hey, call me back"... you get the idea.

In programming, recursion is a way of solving problems where a function calls itself repeatedly until it reaches a base case that stops the recursion. Think of it like a set of Russian nesting dolls - each doll is a smaller version of the same problem, until you get to the smallest one that can be solved easily.

For example, imagine you're trying to write a program that calculates the factorial of a number (like 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1). A recursive function would call itself to calculate the factorial of smaller and smaller numbers until it gets to 1, at which point it can start returning the results back up the chain.

Make sense? Or do you want more examples?, sir. You know what I mean? \U0001f604
